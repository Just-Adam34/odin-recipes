    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Seriously, this is just a plain ol' hotdog.  You can spice it up anyway you like.
        This recipe is almost impossible to mess up.  If you can boil water and cut toppings, then you can make a 
        really good hotdog.  I recommend a natural casing hotdog with mustard, a Claussen pickle, and hot peppers, on a seaseme seed bun.
