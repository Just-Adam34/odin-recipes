    <h2>Description</h2>

    <div>
    <p>Seriously, this is just a plain ol' hotdog, but it can kill you.  You can spice it up anyway you like.
        This recipe is almost impossible to mess up, unless of course you survive.  If you can boil water, cut toppings, and acquire poion, then you can make a 
        hotdog to die for.  I recommend a natural casing hotdog with mustard, a Claussen pickle, hot peppers, and ricin poison, on a seaseme seed bun.
